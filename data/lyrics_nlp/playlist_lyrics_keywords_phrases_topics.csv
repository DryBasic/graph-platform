somehow And I left my scarf there at your sister's house And you've still got it in your drawer even now Oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze We're singin' in the car getting lost upstate Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place And I can picture it after all these days And I know it's long gone and That magic's not here no more And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all Oh oh oh 'Caus there we ar again on that little town street You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turnin' red You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee ball team You taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me And you were tossing me the car keys Fuck the patriarchy Keychain on the ground we were always skippin' town And I was thinkin' on the drive down Any time now He's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was 'Til we were dead and gone and buried Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same After three months in the grave And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as 184You might also like And I know it's long gone and There was nothing else I could do And I forget about you long enough To forget why I needed to 'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light Down the stairs I was there I remember it all too well And there we are again when nobody had to know You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath Sacred prayer and we'd swear To remember it all too well yeah Well maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up Runnin' scared I was there I remember it all too well And you call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lyin' here 'Cause I remember it all all all They say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell Every time you double cross my mind You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would've been fine And that made me want to die The idea you had of me who was she A never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you Not weepin' in a party bathroom Some actress askin' me what happened you That's what happened you You who charmed my dad with self effacing jokes Sippin' coffee like you're on a late night show But then he watched me watch the front door all night willin' you to come And he said It's supposed to be fun turning twenty one Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still tryin' to find it After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone But you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me You can't get rid of it 'Cause you remember it all too well yeah 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known It was rare I was there I remember it all too well Wind in my hair you were there You remember it all Down the stairs you were there You remember it all It was rare I was there I remember it all too well And I was never good at tellin' jokes but the punch line goes I'll get older but your lovers stay my age From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue Just between us did the love affair maim you too 'Cause in this city's barren cold I still remember the first fall of snow And how it glistened as it fell I remember it all too well Just between us did the love affair maim you all too well Just between us do you remember it all too well Just between us I remember it Just between us all too well Wind in my hair I was there I was there I was there Down the stairs I was there I was there Sacred prayer I was there I was

819,1ugkqjRKTAX3kExAR4QgQz,A Nightmare on My Street,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, Now I have a story that I'd like to tell About this guy you all know him he had me scared as hell He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred He wears the same hat and sweater every single day And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm sleep I can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right And we had just gotten back off tour last night So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy If we summoned up the posse and bum rushed the movies I got Angie Jeff got Tina Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life That was all right though 'cause the lady was chill Then we dipped to the theater set to ill Buggin' cold havin' a ball And somethin' bout Elm Street was the movie we saw The way it started was decent you know nothing real fancy About this homeboy named Freddy and this girl named Nancy But word when it was over I said Yo that was def And everything seemed alright when we left But when I got home and laid down to sleep That began the nightmare but on my street You might also like It was burning in my room like an oven My bed soaked with sweat man I was buggin' I checked the clock and it stopped at 12 30 It had melted it was so darn hot and I was thirsty I went downstairs to grab some juice or a Coke Flipped the TV off and then I almost choked When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind It said You turned off David Letterman now you must die Man I ain't even wait to see who it was Broke outside in my drawers and screamed So long cuz Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin' Then thought Oh I get it I must be dreamin I strolled back home with a grin on my grill I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill I walked in the house the Big Bad Fresh Prince But Freddy killed all that noise real quick He grabbed me by my neck and said Here's what we'll do we got a lot of work here me and you The souls of your friends you and I will claim You've got the body and I've got the brain I said Yo Fred I think you've got me all wrong I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long Look I'll be honest man this team won't work The girls won't be on you Fred your face is all burnt I pat him on the shoulder said Thanks for stopping by Then I opened up the door and said Take care guy He got mad drew back his arm and slashed my shirt I laughed at first then thought Hold up that hurt It wasn't a dream man this guy was for real I said Freddy uh pal there's been an awful mistake here No further words and then I darted upstairs Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed Pulled the covers up over my head And said Oh please do somethin' with Fred He jumped on my bed ripped through the covers with his claws Tried to get me but my alarm went off And then silence It was a whole new day I thought Huh I wasn't scared of him anyway Until I noticed those rips in my sheets And that was proof that there had been a nightmare on my street Oh man I gotta call Jeff I gotta call Jeff Come on come on Come on Jeff answer Come on man Hello Jeff this is Prince man Jeff wake up Jeff wake up What do you want Jeff wake up man Listen to me Jeff It's three o'clock in the mornin' what do you want Jeff Jeff would you listen to me Listen whatever you do don't fall asleep Man Jeff listen to me don't go to sleep Jeff Look look I'll talk to you tomorrow I'm going to bed
